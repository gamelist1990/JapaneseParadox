    Paradox AntiCheat is a fork of Scythe AntiCheat, which was released under the GPLv3 License. Paradox was created to fix some differences within Scythe and to provide a more reliable and effective anti-cheat solution for Minecraft Bedrock. All original commit history pertaining to Scythe still exists within this project and is free to review.

  <h2>About Paradox AntiCheat</h2>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat is a powerful tool designed to combat cheating in Minecraft Bedrock worlds. The name "Paradox" was chosen because the concept of paradox perfectly represents the essence of what we do.</p>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat is a statement that contradicts itself. It is a tool that fights cheating by using advanced algorithms and techniques that are themselves paradoxical in nature.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Paradox: A statement or situation that contradicts itself, opposed to common sense and yet perhaps true.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and preventing cheating in Minecraft Bedrock. It uses detection methods to ensure that cheaters are caught and punished. In addition, Paradox AntiCheat is highly customizable, allowing game developers to tailor the tool to their specific needs and requirements.</p>
  <p>If you're looking for a reliable and effective anti-cheat solution for your Minecraft Bedrock experience, look no further than Paradox AntiCheat. For more information, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Pete9xi/Paradox_AntiCheat/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<h1>Applying the Paradox AntiCheat Pack</h1>
<p>When applying the pack to your world make sure the addon is at the top of the behavior pack list and Beta APIs is enabled. This is to ensure all checks and systems work properly. The versioning system for Paradox goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first number denotes the pack version. This will rarely change unless there has been major changes to the code.</li>
  <li>The second number denotes the major revision of the pack version. These particular changes mostly involve around features being added or removed.</li>
  <li>The third number indicates the minor revision of the Pack. This evolves around bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h1><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AXWmBA3.png" border="0" width="150"></h1>
<h1>Installing the Paradox AntiCheat Pack</h1>
<p>To install this anticheat to your realm/world you need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the .mcpack</li>
  <li>Apply it to your world</li>
  <li>Enable Beta APIs</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have done this the anticheat should be fully up and running. Education Edition is required for the command <code>!fly &lt;username&gt;</code> to work.</p>

<h2>Gaining Permission to Use Paradox</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to grant yourself permission to use Paradox in your world:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you're a Realm owner or prefer using a password:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Edit the <code>config.js</code> file located at <code>/scripts/data/config.js</code>.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to the <code>encryption</code> section.</li>
      <li>Inside <code>encryption</code>, find <code>password</code>.</li>
      <li>Enter your chosen password:
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">encryption: {
    password: "mypassword",
}</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="a" start="5">
      <li>Keep your password safe and confidential.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>For all users not using a password:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Install the Anti Cheat and load your Minecraft world.</li>
      <li>In the game's chat, enter <code>&lt;prefix&gt;op</code>. Replace <code>&lt;prefix&gt;</code> with your server's command prefix, e.g., <code>!</code>.</li>
      <li>If you have necessary permissions, this grants you Paradox AntiCheat access.</li>
      <li>Once granted, you'll have Paradox AntiCheat features.</li>
      <li>To give Paradox-Op permissions to others, use <code>&lt;prefix&gt;op &lt;player&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>Learn more by entering <code>&lt;prefix&gt;op help</code>.</li>
      <li>For Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS), add the following to the <code>server.properties</code> file:
        <pre><code>op-permission-level=2
#min=2
#max=4</code></pre>
      </li>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you're using a password (Realm owners), use <code>&lt;prefix&gt;op &lt;password&gt;</code> for permission.</p>
<p>Remember, keep your password secure and share it cautiously.</p>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Paradox will kick you out if you have any illegal items in your inventory so if you think Paradox may flag you after installing then it is highly suggested to drop your entire inventory prior to activating this Anti Cheat!!!</li>
</ul>
