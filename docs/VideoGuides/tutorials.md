## Configuring Paradox OP Password

> In this video, we will download the latest release from GitHub, extract the files, set a password in `config.js`, and then re-zip them. Once zipped, we will convert it to an mcpack ready to be imported. This will also demonstrate setting up a new world and applying the pack.

## Automating OP Password Configuration

> If you are using a PC, Pete9xi has written an application that will do all this for you with a single click of a button. Once the pack has been created, you can double click it, and it will import.
