## Overview

ParadoxUI allows you to manage Paradox through a menu system, with some features exclusively available via the UI. All features are accessible using the GUI system. We are actively working on the GUI, so it may change in future updates.

To get started, simply type `!paradoxui` in chat and then close the window. You will be presented with the main menu, where all options are explained.

## InventoryUI

Paradox offers an inventory system where you can manage and edit a player's inventory.

?> Note: We don't use a chest GUI due to performance reasons.

Once you've selected a player, you'll see their inventory. If the selected slot contains an item, you have the option to edit it using the Item Editor.

## Item Editor

Paradox provides an item editor that allows you to edit various aspects of an item, such as enchantments, lores, name, item replacement, and duplicating the item.

You can also view the stats for an item, which includes enchantments, lores, name, and current durability.

> In this video, we will cover applying enchantments to an item, replacing the item, and removing the item from the player's inventory. When renaming and editing lores, you can use color modifiers.
