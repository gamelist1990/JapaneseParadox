## Command System Via Chat

Paradox utilizes chat commands; all commands are executed in chat. If you are unsure what a command does, you can run the command with the help parameter. For example: `!spawnprotection help`.

## Paradox UI

Paradox also has a GUI. This can be accessed by running `!paradoxui` and then closing chat, allowing the menu to load. You will be prompted by a response in the chat UI to close it. Once loaded, you can then browse all the modules, features, and other options available in Paradox. Some features are exclusive to the GUI, such as InventoryUI and Item Editor.
